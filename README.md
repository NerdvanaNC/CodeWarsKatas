# CodeWars Katas

A repo of all CodeWars (https://www.codewars.com/) Katas/exercises I complete. Each file is a singular self-contained solution with the Kata's link included at the top. The Kyu rating mentioned is a difficulty rating, with lower numbers being more difficult.

Couldn't help myself, some of these are too inspired not to immortalize and show-off. :D
